// Legacy server config removed
//
// The old `config::ServerConfig` was part of the legacy configuration format
// that allowed embedding server listener configuration in the YAML config.
// Support for that section has been removed; runtime server configuration is
// now managed separately. This file is intentionally left as a placeholder
// to avoid accidental re-introduction.
