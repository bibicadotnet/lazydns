# lazydns Documentation

Welcome to the lazydns documentation. This `docs/` folder contains guides, references, and examples to help you use, operate, and develop for lazydns.

Start with the Quickstart to run lazydns locally, or browse the sidebar/SUMMARY to explore the docs.

---

If you maintain released documentation elsewhere (e.g., a hosted site), keep this folder as the canonical repository of source docs (markdown) used to publish that site.

TODO: Add links to key pages and usage examples.
