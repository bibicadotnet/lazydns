sudo apt update
sudo apt install lazydns
```

### 2.2 Raspberry Pi OS (Trixie, arm64)
Use the same repo but restrict to `arm64` architecture in the sources.list entry:
```bash
sudo curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lazywalker/apt/refs/heads/master/debian/key.asc -o /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/lazywalker.asc

```
### 3. Systemd Service Setup (via apt & systemd Linux)

```
the service will auto-start on boot. Check status with:
```bash

brew tap lazywalker/lazydns
brew install lazydns

# make modifications to config file if needed
# then start the service
brew services start lazydns
```

### 5. Docker
Run lazydns from the official Docker image. Example command (adjust volumes, ports and environment as needed):
```bash
docker run -d \
	--name lazydns \
	-p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp \
	-p 853:853/tcp -p 443:443/tcp \

## Upgrading
- From `cargo install`: `cargo install --force lazydns`
- From APT: `sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade` (package upgrades coming from the repo)
- From Docker: pull the new image and recreate the container:
```bash
docker pull lazywalker/lazydns:latest
docker rm -f lazydns
docker run ... (recreate with same args)
```

## Notes
- If you build from source and plan to package, use the `cargo-deb` or native packaging tooling appropriate for your distribution.
- For cross-compilation and reproducible builds, consult the `scripts/cross_build.sh` helper and the `docker/` folder for example Dockerfiles.
